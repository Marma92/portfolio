Professional portfolio development
This tool should evolve. I don't know yet how I'll do it, but I found interesting to share it.

The very first one I made in 2013 is available at https://www.amramelbaz.fr and need to be refreshed/replaced.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, don't hesitate, I'm pretty attentive (and I need some :p )

At the moment (21/10/2016), I don't know yet how I'll develop it. Probably Node.js/ejs templating.

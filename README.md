# Portfolio

### Professional portfolio development

This tool should evolve. I don't know yet how I'll do it, but I found interesting to share it.

The very first one I made in 2013 needed to be refreshed/replaced.



## Current todo/roadmap:

- JSON improvements (so little I knew when I began this project)

- Admin page (for content editing)

- CSS

- Include a blogging system

All this features have to be generic.
I'd like to fill some pages like the CV one thanks to a json parsing system, a bit like my old portfolio, linked higher in this page, but cleaner.


## Licence

MIT (look at LICENCE file, as usual, for more details).

# Portfolio

### Professional portfolio development

This tool should evolve. I don't know yet how I'll do it, but I found interesting to share it.

The very first one I made in 2013 is available at http://www.amramelbaz.fr and need to be refreshed/replaced.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, don't hesitate, I'm pretty attentive (and I need some :p )

I'll develop it using Node.js/ejs templating.


## Current todo/roadmap:

- Basic portfolio features

- Link it with an expresserver generator.py that I want to develop (maybe)

- Define an exact sitemap

- Fill it with my personal informations

- CSS

- Include a blogging system

All this features have to be generic.
I'd like to fill some pages like the CV one thanks to a json parsing system, a bit like my old portfolio, linked higher in this page, but cleaner.
